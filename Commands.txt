git status - to show the status of your git repo whether the new 
file you created or is there any other modification has been made.

git add <filename> - to add your file to the git which is like a 
backstage and it will be visible as A near the file name.

git commit <--m "your message to be displayed"> - to commit the 
changes tha have been made in the local repo which is added to 
the backstage is to be staged.

git push origin main - origin is the link which we took from 
the web repo to access the remote git and the main is to say that 
the file is to be saved and showed in the git repo of the main branch
So this command basically pushes the staged file into the git repo 
of the web so that it is visible there.
