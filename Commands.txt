git status - to show the status of your git repo whether the new 
file you created or is there any other modification has been made.

git add <filename> - to add your file to the git which is like a 
backstage and it will be visible as A near the file name.

git commit <--m "your message to be displayed"> - to commit the 
changes tha have been made in the local repo which is added to 
the backstage is to be staged.

git push origin main - origin is the link which we took from 
the web repo to access the remote git and the main is to say that 
the file is to be saved and showed in the git repo of the main branch
So this command basically pushes the staged file into the git repo 
of the web so that it is visible there.

git pull - to get all the changes made in the web to our remote repo.

git init - to create a new folder in the local repo and with which 
we can make it as a new repo in the web

git remote add origin <link> - after creating th git init you will
go inside the next folder which is out of the repo created. So if you 
add this instead of git push and you need to create a new repo like 
the original one and need to paste that link.

git add . - it works exactly like the git add but what are the files
which are modifiesd will be added to the stage (it includes all the
modified files in that folder).
